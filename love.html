                <h4>Hello Margie, as you can see on the cover page of the virtual card, 
                    this is a special gift for you because since I've been looking for you with Audrey,
                    I already know that I have feelings for you,
                    but of course, before I admit it, I made sure that I'm sure about you because if you didn't come into my life,
                    I had no intention of looking for a woman, but you know the feeling of suddenly liking. 
                    You really expect the unexpected, so now I want to know that I want you more than just being friends,
                    and now I'm going to let you know if I can court you because it's not good to see if we're just flirting. 
                    If you're having second thoughts about me, take your time thinking. I can assure you that I will pursue you and treat you right.</h4>
                <h3>If you allow me to pursue you, send me a white heart on Messenger</h3>
